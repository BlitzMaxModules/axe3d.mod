Using MiniB3D
-------------

* There are two ways of using MiniB3D - as an import file, or as a module.
* To use MiniB3D as an import file, copy 'minib3d.bmx' and the 'inc' folder to the same folder as your main source code file. Then use 'Import "minib3d.bmx"' at the top of your program to import MiniB3D.
* To use MiniB3D as a module, copy the module folder 'sidesign.mod' into your BlitzMax 'mod' folder and build it (you can do this by pressing Ctrl + D in the BlitzMax IDE). Then use 'Import sidesign.minib3d' at the top of your program to use MiniB3D as a module.
* In order to compile MiniB3D on Windows, you will need MinGW 5.1.3 installed. See this thread for more info: http://www.blitzbasic.com/Community/posts.php?topic=72892
* If you have problems compiling MiniB3D programs due to MinGW errors, try a fresh install of MinGW and/or BlitzMax.

MiniB3D and the Blitz3D SDK
---------------------------

* In order to maximise compatibility on all systems, you may consider it preferable to have a single project that uses the Blitz3D SDK (DirectX) for the Windows version of your program, and MiniB3D (OpenGL) for the Mac and Linux versions. 
* In order to make it as easy as possible to use both the BlitzSDK and MiniB3D for the same project, follow these guidelines:
* Copy the contents of the 'blitz3dsdk.mod' folder included with MiniB3D into your actual BlitzMax blitz3dsdk mod folder (you may want to backup the original files)
* These modified files remove the 'bb' prefix from all the Blitz3D SDK function names so that the MiniB3D and Blitz3D SDK function names are the same.
* The files also include an updated set of keycodes which are mapped to work the same as the BlitzMax keycodes when using the Blitz3D SDK.
* To use the BlitzSDK instead of MiniB3D, simply comment out the line at the top of your programs that include or imports MiniB3D, and replace it with these lines:

Framework BRL.Basic
Import brl.retro
Import blitz3d.blitz3dsdk
BeginBlitz3D()

* You will of course have to match up the MiniB3D and Blitz3D SDK functions that you use. This will mean that:
* You will not be able to use functions in the Blitz3D SDK that are not available in BlitzMax + MiniB3D.
* You will not be able to use Max2D functions
* When using MiniB3D, you will have to use functions rather than methods, i.e. you will have to use PositionEntity(entity,0,0,0) rather than entity.PositionEntity(0,0,0)
* When using MiniB3D, you will have to use ints to store entity handles rather than using objects directly, i.e. cam=CreateCamera() rather than cam:TCamera=CreateCamera(). This means you will not be able to use Strict/SuperStrict.
* Using ints instead of objects is somewhat slower though, so you may want to use objects in your MiniB3D version, and then remove all :TType tags before compiling a Blitz3D SDK version.
* Other minor issues may crop up. Feel free to inform me of these at simonh@blitzbasic.com so I can improve MiniB3D and Blitz3D SDK co-operability in future versions.

MiniB3D and Max2D
-----------------

* MiniB3D allows you to integrate Max2D rendering with MiniB3D rendering.
* To do so, after you have used RenderWorld but before you use Flip, use BeginMax2D(), then use your Max2D drawing commands, and then use EndMax2D().
* See 'examples/max2d.bmx' for an example.

MiniB3D and MaxGUI
------------------

* MiniB3D allows you to integrate MaxGUI with MiniB3D.
* You must have purchased and downloaded the MaxGUI module first.
* See 'examples/maxgui.bmx' for an example.

General Notes
-------------

* TurnEntity doesn't works exactly like Blitz3D's TurnEntity - see TurnEntity notes below
* MiniB3D uses BackBufferToTex for dynamic textures - see 'BackBufferToTex' below
* MiniB3D uses bounding spheres for frustum culling as opposed to B3D's OBBs - see 'MeshCullRadius' below
* Non-boned animations not supported yet
* Bone scaling (does anybody use bone scaling?) not supported yet
* Sprite view modes 3 and 4 not supported yet
* Texture flags 128 and 512 not supported
* In Blitz3D, collision types set with EntityType must be between 0-999. In MiniB3D, they must be between 0-99.

TurnEntity Notes
----------------

* MiniB3D's TurnEntity does not work the same as Blitz3D's TurnEntity.
* Blitz3D's TurnEntity, with the global flag enabled, allows for true quaternion rotations, MiniB3D's TurnEntity does not.
* As Blitz3D uses quaternions internally, and MiniB3D does not (it uses eulers), this can't yet be supported in MiniB3D.

BackBuffToTex (MiniB3D only)
----------------------------

* This command is included as MiniB3D currently does not have the same buffer commands as Blitz3D.
* Use this command to copy a region of the backbuffer to a texture.
* The region copied from the backbuffer will start at (0,0), and end at the texture's width and height.
* Therefore if you want to copy the whole of a 3D scene to a texture, you must first resize the camera viewport to the size of the texture, use RenderWorld to render the camera, then use this command to copy the backbuffer to the texture.
* Note that if a texture has the mipmap flag enabled (by default it does), then this command must be called for each mipmap, otherwise the texture will appear to fade into a different, non-matching mipmap as you move away from it. A routine similar to the one below will copy the backbuffer to each mipmap, making sure the camera viewport is the same size as the mipmap.

For i=0 Until tex.CountMipmaps()
	CameraViewport 0,0,tex.MipmapWidth(),tex.MipmapHeight()
	Renderworld
	BackBufferToTex(tex,i)
Next

* It may be easier to disable the mipmap flag for the texture. To do so, use ClearTextureFilters after calling Graphics3D (the mipmap flag is a default filter).
* If you are using this command to copy to a cubemap texture, use SetCubeFace to first select which portion of the texture you will be copying to. Note that in MiniB3D mipmaps are not used by cubemaps, so ignore the information about mipmaps for normal textures above.
* See the cubemap.bmx example included with MiniB3D to learn more about cubemapping.

MeshCullRadius (MiniB3D only)
-----------------------------

* This command is the equivalent of Blitz3D's MeshCullBox command.
* It is used to set the radius of a mesh's 'cull sphere' - if the 'cull sphere' is not inside the viewing area, the mesh will not be rendered.
* A mesh's cull radius is set automatically, therefore in most cases you will not have to use this command.
* You may have to use this command for animated meshes where the default cull radius may not take into account all animation positions, resulting in the mesh being wrongly culled at extreme positions.
* You must use this command for scaled sprites as MiniB3D does not currently take into account the size of scaled sprites before culling them.
